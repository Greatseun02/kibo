<p class="heading1">MY TOP 3 CORE VALUES AND HOW THEY REFLECT IN MY CURRENT LIFE
</p>
<p><span>FAMILY:</span> As Michael J.Fox said, "Family is not an important thing; it's everything." In the community I grew up in, family is everything to us. One could say after God, that family is the next in line. Family is our only support system; they help us in times of need and are always there for us. Growing up in a family of five, where I am the youngest child, I always look up to my elder siblings, and I admire them, from my brother's brilliance to my sister's hard work and discipline. When most times I am down and faced with a challenge, I mostly think about what my siblings would do, and I do that. They have laid a good example for me, which I must follow. I also intend to follow in their footsteps and eventually surpass their expectations of me. Family keeps me going in life, and thinking about all the sacrifices my family has made to make my life easier makes me push through any challenge I face. I recall the one-year diploma program I did to gain admission into the University of Lagos; I made sure I excelled in it to make my family proud.
</p>
<p><span>Adventure:</span> I always love a good adventure, and this is one of the reasons I decided to choose a computer-related course to study in college because it's challenging, fun, and creative. Programming is something new to me, and it would be an adventure learning it and using it to solve problems to help people. Before going for my diploma at the University of Lagos in 2020, I was told it was a challenging program, and many people fail every year. I took up the challenge because it was an opportunity to go on a new adventure and live on my own away from my parents, which was new to me. At the end of the program, it was a worthy decision because I passed the program and went on to be admitted to study Computer Science at the University of Lagos. In closing, I once read a quote, "Only the people who risk going too far can find out how far they can go."
</p>
<p><span>MEANINGFUL WORK:</span> I always wonder what people think about me when they remember me. I ensure to put in extra effort to leave a lasting effect where people remember me as that guy who assisted them in whatever they were struggling with. I once helped a colleague study for an exam in which he excelled, and I remember him saying, "You helped my life, and it's because of you I did well in this exam." I always want to be part of meaningful work, something significant that will leave a legacy and have a big impact.
