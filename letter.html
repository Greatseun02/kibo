<p class="heading2">A letter to your current self from the year 2032</p>
<p>Hi past me, it's you from the future. It has been seven years since I left Kibo College, and I am currently in Tokyo, Japan working with my robotics team on a project. It has been two years since we started the project, and we are very close to launching our first product to the public. It has passed the performance and safety test procedures, and I'm excited about how close we are to launching it and happy about how far we have come since we completed our B.sc in Computer Science from Kibo. The project is about domesticating humanoid robots, where it can be purchased and programmed to assist humans in their day-to-day activities with varying levels of complexity.
</p>
<p>It's been a long ten years, and we worked hard to get to where we are today. After we got our computer science degree from Kibo, our life changed for the better. We created different softwares that solved many problems in our current society. We got a lot of opportunities and had a lot of support from mentors and classmates at Kibo. We took advantage of the opportunities that came our way, and we worked for different robotics companies for some years until we left to continue our robotics research. Our research went on for two years, and then we decided to use the knowledge and experience gathered in our research. We formed a team with four brilliant Robotics engineers and Robotics programmers and started working on our promising robotics project.
</p>
<p>I'm happy for the experience we got from attending Kibo college. The experience brought out our better version, which helped us focus on accomplishing our dreams. I remember the projects that shaped us, developed our mindset and built our teamwork skills, which enabled us to persevere through and go far, just like the quote, "Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much".
</p>
<p>In closing, always remember that life is a journey, not a race; take things slow. Be determined and keep pursuing your dreams with all you've got. You might get tired, discouraged, or feel like quitting. Just remember what you are doing, why you are doing it and who you are doing it for. You can change the plan but don't change the goal.
</p>
<p>Keep pursuing your dreams and passion. When allowed to study at Kibo college, make the best of your opportunity, give it your all and excel in every challenge Kibo has to offer. I'm rooting for you till we meet in the future.
